# FASTA-Glycan-Seqon-Checker

Program needs to be compiled, expects files to be located in local directory. Included .txt file is only a test file, does not contain all FASTA sequences, full FASTA file can be obtained from: https://cdn.rcsb.org/rcsb-pdb/general_information/news_publications/newsletters/2004q2/query.html

Current issues: 

FASTA file contains sequences of multiple chains for a single protein, thus inflating the numbers
Program does not currently highlight where it had found a matching sequence
